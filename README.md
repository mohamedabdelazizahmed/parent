## Apology
I would like to apologize for not implementing two parts :- 
- Unit tests
- Docker  
The unite test part The opportunity to work did not come before, and this is a part I want to learn more .
The Doker part :- I have tried more than once in the Deploy section in docker ,Where the opportunity did not come to work through, due to the presence of a special team part 
Docker &Deploy
